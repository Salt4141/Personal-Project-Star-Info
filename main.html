                        Stars form in big clouds of dust, and gas in space, composed of many different particles of different mass, left over from dying stars, barely above absolute zero, called "interstellar molecular clouds." Inside these clouds, clumps start to form, as the gravity of stars nearby tug on the particles inside. These clumps of dust, and gas are the beginnings of a star, called a "protostar." Since the protostars are the densest parts of the molecular clouds, they have the highest gravity, and attract more matter, and grow faster, further increasing their gravity. Since the protostar is also spinning while pulling in matter, it transfers some of its rotation to the matter, flattening the particles around it into a "protoplanetary disk," as they spin into the star. In this disk, clumps will form again, but they usually become planets, because they don't have enough mass to create fusion. But, the young star's gravity also pushes down on the star, giving it its spherical shape; other than its shape, the gravity also pushes the particles in the star closer together, increasing the protostar's density, and pressure, and therefore, its temperature. Eventually, the temperature at the core of the protostar is so hot that the particles are moving fast enough, that when they collide, they release a bunch of energy, and fuse together to from a new particle; this process is called "nuclear fusion," and is what keeps a star from being crushed under its own gravity. Now that the protostar has begun fusion, it is a main sequence star, in which it will burn hydrogen to helium to combat the force of gravity.

                        Most of the stars in the universe are main sequence, which just means that they are currently burning hydrogen into helium. All stars eventually become main sequence, and stars spend most of their lives in this phase. They fuse hydrogen to helium in the following reaction: 4H -> He + E. The fusion starts because of the high pressure in the star's core caused by the star's gravity compressing the star. Eventually the temperature in the core of the star reaches many millions of degrees, and the hydrogen atoms start moving so fast that when they collide, they fuse into helium atoms, and the gas becomes plasma. These fusion reactions create pressure, which counters the force of gravity, and stabilizes the star, stopping its collapse under gravity; the point at which the pressure balances out against gravity is called the "hydrostatic equilirbium." As the star turns hydrogen to helium, the heavier helium pushes the hydrogen out out of the core, and to the star's outer-layers, creating different layers of different elements based on mass, because heavier elements sink to the center. But the star doesn't have infinite hydrogen, and the new helium is pushing the hydrogen to the outer-shell, so eventually the star runs out of hydrogen to fuse in the core, and gravity wins over again, and the star continues its collapse. But, as the density, and pressure rise again with the core's collapse, the temperature rises, and eventually is high enough to fuse the hydrogen in the shell, and the helium in the core. Since the amount of time a star can burn hydrogen for is relative to the amount of pressure it needs to combat gravity, more massive stars fuse hydrogen quicker, than less massive ones, because they need more pressure to maintain the hydrostatic equilibrium.

                    <p id="redG-p">
                        After fusing all the hydrogen in its core, the star's temperature isn't high enough to fuse helium, because helium is too heavy, so gravity wins for a time, and compresses the core. And once more, the temperature rises. Fusion of helium starts, as many helium atoms collide, fusing into mostly carbon, and oxygen via the reactions: 3He -> C + E, or 4He -> O + E. But this time, the temperature of the shell rises high enough to fuse hydrogen, and the heat created in the shell from fusion causes it to expand greatly. After burning through its helium supply, the star now has a bunch of different elements; depending on its mass, the star can go one of two ways. If the star's mass is 1.44 solar masses, called the "Chandrasekhar Limit" (1 solar mass ≈ 1,989,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg = the mass of the Sun), then the temperature in the core will never be high enough to fuse carbon, and it will shed its outer-layers in a "planetary nebula," and the core will be left exposed, and the star will have become a "white dwarf." But if the star's mass is greater than 1.44 solar masses, then the star's core will continue to be compressed by gravity, and temperatures will keep rising. The star will fuse carbon, oxygen, sodium, magnesium, and other atoms created through fusion, until the core becomes iron. Since fusing iron takes more energy than it produces, the core can't fuse iron into heavier elements, and it collapses under its own gravity, and explodes outwards in a "supernova," pushing the outer-layers far into the universe, and either leaving behind a hot ball of neutrons, called a "neutron star," or a "black hole."

                        As the star can no longer fuse atoms in its core, gravity wins, and the star can go one of two ways. If the star's mass is small enough, it will quietly release its outer-layers in a beautiful "planetary nebula," leaving its core exposed. But if the star is big enough, then it will violently collapse under its own gravity, exploding in under a second, and throwing its outer-shell into the universe, while the matter in the core is compressed in strange ways.

                            If a star is less than 1.44 solar masses, it will never be hot enough to fuse carbon, and gravity compresses the core. The core can no longer hold on to its outer-shells, and sheds them away in beautiful "planetary nebulae", the remnants of the star's shell, while the core becomes a hot "white dwarf". Since the core is plasma, the protons are stuck in the nuclei of carbon, or oxygen, while the electrons are freely floating about in the core. Gravity compresses the dead star so much, that the electrons are almost touching, but since like-charges repel, the electrons push back against each other, stabilizing the core, and preventing its collapse. The surface of a white dwarf is really hot, but since they don't fuse elements, they can't sustain their heat, and slowly cool off, eventually going dark, and becomes a "black dwarf," the final stage in its life. But more massive stars, have a more violent fate, an explosion

                            If a star's mass surpasses the "Chandrasekhar Limit," 1.44 solar masses," it will end in an explosion, called a "supernova." After the massive star's core has created iron from fusion, it collapses in on itself because iron is too heavy to fuse. The collapse takes place in under a second, and in the explosion, the star's gravity pulls in all the outer-layers really quickly, and the temperature is finally high enough to fuse all the iron into heavier elements; the pressure created is more than enough to counter gravity, and sends all the matter around it flying into space. It is thought that this is how every element heavier than iron is created. What happens to the core though? Well, if the mass is small enough, but still bigger than the Chandrasekhar Limit, the electrons orbiting the atoms in the core of the star will fall into their nucleus, and become a proton. What remains is a hot ball of neutrons, one of the smallest stars in the universe, and one of the densest. Or if the star is huge, then the whole thing collapses into a finite volume, with infinite mass, meaning a point of infinite density.

                            If a star has a mass between 1.44, and 2.2 solar masses, then it will become a "neutron star." During the supernova of a star with a mass greater than 1.44 solar masses, but less than 2.2 solar masses, the core will collapse, and the electrons will be forced into their nuclei. The result is a ball, about 20 km wide, of neutrons. Neutron stars are really hot, and dense. They have about the final mass of the sun, but since its condensed into a sphere of diameter 20 km, it is really dense. They fight gravity in a similar way to "white dwarfs," the neutrons can't be in the same place at the same time, so they balance out against gravity. These stars spin really fast, over 100 times per second, and they have the strongest magnetic field of all known objects. At the magnetic poles, neutron stars produce a stream of photons because their magnetic field is so huge, and sometimes, the magnetic poles, aren't the same as the their rotation, so they pulse, these are called "pulsars." Like white dwarfs, neutron stars do not produce any heat via fusion, and slowly cool off, and slow their rotation.

                            If a star is greater than 2.2 solar masses, then it not even the neutrons formed in the supernova survive, as all the matter left in the core is crushed into a finite space with infinite mass, these are called "black holes." The high mass of black holes leads their gravity to be so high, that not even light can escape a black hole, so they appear black. The point at which you would need to move faster than the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s) is called its "event horizon," and it appears to be a black sphere around the "singularity," the center of the star. Black holes create disks around themselves much like protostars, called "accretion disks." An accretion disk is composed of matter trapped in the gravitational pull of a black hole, and the black hole slowly absorbs the matter, because black holes convert mass to "hawking radiation," so if they don't get more matter, they will have converted their whole mass into hawking radiation, and this effect gets progressively faster, so the mass will deplete faster as the black hole loses more mass.

                    "Red dwarfs," are the smallest stars in the universe. Red dwarfs have really low masses, and size, and because of this, their luminosity, the rate at which they fuse hydrogen, is really low. So they can live for billions, to trillions of years. These stars also don't become red giants like most stars, because of a process called "convection" in the star. Basically, the helium created through fusion is mixed up throughout the star, and therefore there won't be enough helium in the core of the star to star helium fusion. So instead, the red dwarf becomes a "blue dwarf," before turning into a "white dwarf." Since red dwarfs use their hydrogen supply slower than other stars, there are more red dwarfs than any other star in the universe. And red dwarfs live so long, that none of them have become blue dwarfs yet, and they will likely be the last stars to die.

They have the highest luminosities of any star. They make up the biggest stars in the universe. When they become red giants, they are so massive, that they are called "red supergaints," and erupt in supernovae at the end of their life, eventually becoming black holes.

During the protostar phase, many different clumps form, but they all accumulate enough to become stars. In this case, many stars form. Two-star systems are called "binaries," and three-star systems are called "trinaries." Sometimes, if the stars are close enough, and their masses sufficient, then one star can siphon mass off of the other; for example, if a neutron star orbits, another main sequence star, it will take its mass, but if the neutron star is orbiting another neutron star, they will siphon off of each other, and merge into a black hole.

                <p id="grav-p">
                    Gravity plays a key part in star formation. The gravity of a protostars, for example, allows the young star to attract matter, which will support nuclear fusion later in its life. Gravity is a force of attraction; it is the acceleration an object attracts all other objects towards it with, in relation to its mass, and distance, and the force at which the object is pulling another object is equal to the acceleration x the mass of the other object (F = ma). This means that all objects, regardless of weight, fall at the same speed, if they are at the same height, but the force they have, depends on the mass. The acceleration is equal to a really small number, called the "gravitational constant" (G ≈ 0.000000000066743 Nm^2 / kg^2), x the mass of the object, divided by the distance between the two objects squared (a = G x m / d^2). So F = m x (G x m / d^2).

                    Temperature, density, and pressure play a key role in star formation, and lifecycles. Density is a measure of the amount of mass in a certain space; pressure is a measure of force on an area, and temperature in astronomy, measured in kelvin, is a measure of how fast particles are moving, because the faster particles move, the more energy they have, and therefore the hotter it is. Density is important in star formation, because as protostars accumulate mass, their density increases, and when density increase, it means that there's more particles, so they collide more often, and there's more force per unit area, and therefore a high pressure. The extra collisions lead to higher energy, and higher temperature. Temperature, pressure, and density are the reason fusion starts, because the attraction of mass, leads to higher density, leading to higher pressure, and therefore higher temperature. Temperature also plays a key part in luminosity, because, two stars, all else being equal, the hotter star, has a higher luminosity.

                <p id="lumi-brig-p">
                    Luminosity is the measure of "electromagnetic energy" per second emitted by a star. The electromagnetic energy of a star is equivalent to the radiant energy produced by the star. Radiant energy is carried by photons, light, and the "frequency" of the photon, the rate at which it travels, determines the type of radiation. The photons carrying the radiation are created during the nuclear reactions in the core. Luminosity can be calculated using the "Stefan-Boltzmann Law," which says that the radiant energy emitted at all frequenices per second is equal to the "stefan-boltzmann constant" (0.00000005670374419 W/ (m^2 * K^4)) x temperature to 4th power x the emissivity of the celestial body, in other words, how good it is at absorbing, and emitting radiation on a scale of 0, to 1, x the surface area of the star, but since stars are practially perfect emitters, and absorbers of radiation (called "black bodies"), their emissivity is rounded to 1, so the final equation looks like: E = σ x T^4 x S. The luminosity of a star determines how long it can fuse hydrogen for, and therefore its lifetime, and it determines the brightness of the star. The brightness of a star is relative to its distance, meaning that the brightness depends on how far you are measuring the brightness from. So the brightness is equal to the luminosity divided by the surface area of a sphere with a radius equal to the distance of the point of you are measure to the center of the star, because the luminosity spreads out evenly, so it is divded by a sphere of a radius of the, giving the equation: B = L / S.

                    Nuclear fusion is the life force of stars, producing heat, and energy, generating pressure, because fusion increases the heat, and therefore the particles hit each other more, and produce more force. During nuclear fusion, the atoms in the star are moving so fast that they collide with enough force to become a new heavier atom, and the reaction creates a lot of energy based on E = mc^2. The energy created from the nuclear reactions, increases the pressure, combating the force of gravity trying to compress the star. Different types of atoms take more temperature to fuse, because heavier atoms need more energy to fuse, so stars have a period of contraction between each time they start fusing a new element to combat gravity, but fusing energy takes a lot of energy to raise the temperature high enough, and therefore when stars fuse iron into their cores, they can't fuse it because they need so much energy to fuse it, and can only fuse it during supernova.

                    All the elements in the universe, from helium, to oganesson originate in the core of the star. Lighter elements (meaning elements lighter than iron), were formed through fusion in the core of a star, while heavier elements (meaning elements as heavy as, or heavier than iron) were formed in supernovae of massive stars, under the intense heat, and pressure of a collapsing star's core. Originally, all the atoms in the universe were hydrogen, but stars formed, and slowly fused the hydrogen in their cores to helium, and then to carbon, and oxygen, creating new elements in the process. Since most of the stars in the universe don't go supernovae when they die, they just shed their outer-layers, and release the elements they formed through fusion into the universe. These elements being shoved out into the universe, mix into some interstellar clouds, and now the future generation of stars, are not fully hydrogen, so the stars can burn for less, and less time because they don't have as much starting hydrogen. Between these elements the distribution in terms of amount of each elements skews towards lighter elements, as lighter element require less energy to fuse, and are therefore easier to obtain. So thr most common elements in the universe are, hydrogen, helium, carbon, and oxygen, because they are light, and easy to form via nuclear fusion. Heavier elements form during supernovae, because the only time particles have enough energy to fuse is during the intense heat, and pressrue caused by the collapse of a star. During the supernova, the iron in the core doesn't change, so the mass stays the same, but the density increase, and therefore the pressure, and temperature also increases, in that spilt second, the iron atoms collide, and fuse into heavier elements, creating everything from cobalt to uranium, and more.
